## üìñ Project Background

Problem Space - Social Isolation: 
- The isloation of COVID - 19 continues to have a significant impact on our physical and health health.
- In a survey study, 59% of respondents stated that they felt socially isolated and found it harder to make social connections since the pandemic.
  
### `How might we create opportunities for adults in the GTA to build meaningful social connections through sports?`

Sports, especially a sport like volleyball, is a great way to make friends and bring people together.

Reasons for choosing Volleyball
1. Requires much more organiziation than most other sports
2. Team sport (6vs6)
3. Coed
4. Quickly becoming one of the most popular sports in North America

## üëì What I Learned

During this project, I applied many different skills to build a real and public project!

### üíª `Google APIs`:
- **Google Maps**: In order to create a map view of the volleyball games, the Google Maps API was used as a tool to visualize the data in a farmiliar UI. 
- **Google Places**: This API allows me to convert the address of a volleyball game as a coordinate that can be placed as a pin onto the Google maps view.

### üíæ `AWS EC2`:
- To deploy the project, I used the AWS EC2 web service. This service provides a secure, virtual computer to run and host the application so that it can be shared.

## üí≠ How can it be improved?
For future iterations, here are some other features that could be introduced to improve this product.

- User Authentication & Profile: By allowing users to authenticate and create a profile, they can save their settings and store the list of games that they have signed up for.
- Personalization: Offer ways for users to personalize their profile by including a bio and other traits such as experience level or preference of positions.
